# JunoCam Bot
 Twitter bot that tweets the latest publically shared imagery from the JunoCam team.  

 A live bot is hosted at [@JunoImgBot](https://twitter.com/JunoImgBot).

 ## Install
 You will need a recent version of Python 3, alongside a working pip package installer.

 After downloading the repository, install the depedencies from requirements.txt, with the command:

 `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

 You will need a [Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/), with all 4 keys provided an in .env file in the root directory of the program to authenticate the bot (more info on keys: https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/auth_tutorial.html).

 After doing so, run main.py, which will ask for the current number the JunoCam dataset is on.  This can be found on the main twitter account's bio.

 ## Contact
I can be contacted via the following methods:
* Email: `christianmigueldiaz@gmail.com`
* Discord: `chrisd149#7640`

I will try my best to respond to legitimate questions/inquires at soon as possible, however it may take me a few days at most.
